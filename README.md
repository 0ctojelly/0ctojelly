⠄･ ⋆ about me 

ᰍ you can call me by the character name or in-game name of my pony. i'll share my real name if i'm comfortable with you! 

ᰍ im a dumb little **minor** who knows nothing about the cruel world..  for my specific age, i'll tell you if you ask me

ᰍ i go by she/they, but i don't mind if you call me by the pronouns of whoever my pony is ˙ᵕ˙

ᰍ i mainly sit around and observe others, but you're always free to talk with me! i might be awkward depending if i vibe with you or not...other than that, i'm pretty talkative most of the time! :D
