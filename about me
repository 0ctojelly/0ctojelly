you can call me by the character name or in-game name of my pony. i'll share my real name if i'm comfortable with you!

if you wanna know my exact age, just ask me (only if i've already been talking to you for a while!!)

i go by she/they, but i don't mind if you call me by the pronouns of whoever my pony is ˙ᵕ˙

i mainly sit around and observe others, but you're always free to talk with me! i might be awkward depending if i vibe with you or not...other than that, i'm pretty talkative most of the time! :D
